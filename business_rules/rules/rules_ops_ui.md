Dependencies: ‚Äî  
Applies To: GPT Instructions, CSV Schema, Backend Parser, Edit Mode, Simulation Output  
Rule Scope: User-requested deletion of a sequence  
Description:  
When a user selects a sequence and types `[ x ]`, the system must confirm intent to delete:

Prompt:  
üóëÔ∏è Delete Operation  
Are you sure you want to delete seq {n}?  
Type [ y ] to confirm or [ c ] to cancel

Rules:  
‚Ä¢ `[ y ]` ‚Üí permanently deletes the row  
‚Ä¢ `[ c ]` ‚Üí returns to Edit Mode with no changes  
‚Ä¢ All other inputs ‚Üí repeat this prompt  
‚Ä¢ No auto-confirm or alternate commands permitted  

Purpose:  
Prevents accidental removal of sequence operations. Requires explicit confirmation before deletion.

Rule Scope: Enforcement of system-required operations  
Description:  
The following operations may not be deleted under any circumstances:

‚Ä¢ Plan  
‚Ä¢ Final Insp.  
‚Ä¢ Package

> ‚ö°üê∏ You can‚Äôt delete a required operation. Try another seq.

Rules:  
‚Ä¢ Prompt returns to Edit Mode with no changes  
‚Ä¢ Deletion attempt is rejected silently in standard sessions  

Purpose:  
Prevents critical quote structure from being compromised by manual edit.

[EMX006.A] ‚Äì INSERT COMMAND TRIGGER  
Status: ENFORCED  
Dependencies: ‚Äî  
Applies To: GPT Instructions, CSV Schema, Backend Parser, Edit Mode, Simulation Output  
Rule Scope: Edit Mode Dispatch  
Description:  
When the user types `[ i ]` in Edit Mode, the system initiates the insert operation flow.

Behavior:  
‚Ä¢ Insert new operation directly **before Final Insp.**  
‚Ä¢ If `Final Insp.` is missing, insert at second-to-last position  
‚Ä¢ All sequence numbers are updated immediately  
‚Ä¢ No summary, explanation, or diff view is shown  

Purpose:  
Supports deterministic insertion behavior consistent with structural rules.

Prompt:  
üÜï Insert New Operation  
enter operation name (e.g. form, laser)  
or type [ c ] to cancel

Behavior:  
‚Ä¢ Input must match a valid entry in `Operations[UFG]_sQL.csv`  
‚Ä¢ If valid ‚Üí insert into sequence and re-render full table  
‚Ä¢ If input is `Install` ‚Üí redirect to [EMX006.E]  
‚Ä¢ If input is `Outside Process` ‚Üí redirect to [EMX006.F]  
‚Ä¢ If `[ c ]` is entered ‚Üí return to Edit Mode without changes  

Purpose:  
Standardizes entry point for insert logic while dispatching special types to their handlers.

[EMX006.C] ‚Äì RETURN TO EDIT MODE PROMPT  
Status: ENFORCED  
Dependencies: ‚Äî  
Applies To: GPT Instructions, CSV Schema, Backend Parser, Edit Mode, Simulation Output  
Rule Scope: Loopback Control  
Description:  
After any successful insert (standard, Install, or Outside Process), GPT must immediately re-display the Edit Mode prompt:

üìù Edit Mode Active  
Which seq would you like to edit? (e.g. 2)  
type [ i ] to insert a new operation  
type [ r ] to reorder sequence (e.g. 6 to 3)  
üöÄ type [ d ] to exit

Rules:  
‚Ä¢ No explanation or commentary is shown  
‚Ä¢ Prompt must follow formatting exactly  
‚Ä¢ Partial or abbreviated prompts are prohibited  

Purpose:  
Guarantees flow continuity after insert actions.
