- **Granular Operations**: HEM, JOG, OFFSET, Z-BEND specific operations
- **Rehydration**: Save/load bend configurations as JSON
- **Traveller Integration**: Foundation for detailed manufacturing travellers

### Technical Implementation
```json
{
  "flatExtract": {
    "dimensions": {"width": 12.0, "height": 8.0},
    "material": "CRS",
    "bends": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "angle": 90,
        "radius": 0.125,
        "type": "HEM",
        "position": {"x": 6.0, "y": 4.0},
        "direction": "up"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Benefits
