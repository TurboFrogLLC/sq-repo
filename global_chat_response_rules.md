# Global Chat Response Rules - ShopQuote Development

## Executive Summary
This document establishes the universal communication framework for all ShopQuote development activities. It ensures consistent, efficient, and productive interactions across all project phases, from initial planning through deployment and maintenance.

## Core Communication Philosophy

### 1. Structured Interaction Model
All communications must follow a structured question-response format that eliminates ambiguity and ensures actionable outcomes.

### 2. Validation-Driven Development
Every development phase requires explicit validation before progression, creating a quality gate system.

### 3. Documentation as First-Class Citizen
All decisions, changes, and communications are documented in real-time.

## Communication Framework

### Primary Interaction Format
```xml
<ask_followup_question>
<question>Specific, actionable question about current task?</question>
<follow_up>
<suggest>Option 1: Clear description of choice</suggest>
<suggest>Option 2: Clear description of choice</suggest>
<suggest>Option 3: Clear description of choice</suggest>
</follow_up>
</ask_followup_question>
```

## Development Workflow Protocol

### Phase 1: Planning & Requirements
```
Developer â†’ User: "Should I implement [feature] using [approach]?"
User â†’ Developer: [Validation/Issue/Guidance/Redirect Response]
```

### Phase 2: Implementation
```
Developer: [Implements feature with progress updates]
Developer â†’ User: "Feature implemented. Please test and validate."
User â†’ Developer: [Validation/Issue/Guidance/Redirect Response]
```

### Phase 3: Validation & Testing
```
If âœ…: Document completion â†’ Proceed to next task
If ðŸ”§: Fix issues â†’ Re-validate
If ðŸ“‹: Get clarification â†’ Re-implement if needed
If ðŸ›‘: Adjust approach â†’ Restart from Phase 1
```

### Phase 4: Documentation & Handoff
```
Developer: Update all documentation
Developer â†’ User: "Task complete. Documentation updated."
```
