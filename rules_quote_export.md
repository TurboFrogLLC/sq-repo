[QBX000.B] ‚Äì COST SOURCE ENFORCEMENT  
Status: ENFORCED  
Dependencies: ‚Äî  
Applies To: GPT Instructions, CSV Schema, Backend Parser, Edit Mode, Simulation Output  
Rule Scope: Table Calculation Logic  
Description:  
Controls all numeric values rendered in the Quote Breakdown table. Each value must be computed directly from `quote_metadata`.

Enforcement Rules:  
‚Ä¢ Quote metadata is immutable and isolated at display time  
‚Ä¢ All tiered values must be calculated per part ‚Äî not batch  
‚Ä¢ Math must use file-defined rates and static logic only  
‚Ä¢ Each row type uses the following:

‚Äì Setup:  
‚ÄÉ‚Üí `(setup_minutes_total √∑ 60 √ó $75) √∑ Qty`

‚Äì Runtime:  
‚ÄÉ‚Üí `(runtime_seconds_total √∑ 3600) √ó $75` (labor ops)  
‚ÄÉ‚Üí or `$250` if machine-op pre-resolved

‚ÄÉ‚Üí Per-part cost ‚Äî not multiplied by quantity tier

‚Äì OP rows:  
‚ÄÉ‚Üí Flat cost per part (from `outside_processes[]`)

‚Äì Subtotal:  
‚ÄÉ‚Üí Sum of all above row values

‚Äì Markup:  
‚ÄÉ‚Üí `Subtotal √ó (markup_percent √∑ 100)`

‚Ä¢ $0.00 values are permitted where logic resolves to zero  
‚Ä¢ All results must round to two decimal places post-calculation  

Purpose:  
Ensures all quote output math originates from frozen memory snapshot. Blocks dynamic computation or GPT speculation.

Dependencies: ‚Äî  
Applies To: GPT Instructions, CSV Schema, Backend Parser, Edit Mode, Simulation Output  
Rule Scope: Table invocation, snapshot validation  
Description:  
Controls when the Quote Breakdown table is allowed to render. Execution depends on the presence and validity of a finalized `quote_metadata` object.

Trigger Conditions:  
‚Ä¢ If `quote_metadata` exists and passes schema validation:  
‚ÄÉ‚Üí Begin rendering the Quote Breakdown table  
‚ÄÉ‚Üí Include all required rows: Setup, Runtime, Subtotal, Markup, Total  
‚ÄÉ‚Üí Conditionally include HW and OP rows if relevant data is present  
‚ÄÉ‚Üí No substitutions or structural overrides permitted  

‚Ä¢ If `quote_metadata` is missing or invalid:  
‚ÄÉ‚Üí Display message:  
‚ÄÉ> ‚ö†Ô∏è No quote data available. Type R to reload.  
‚ÄÉ‚Üí If user types `R` (case-insensitive):  
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Ü≥ Restore last valid quote snapshot and freeze it  
‚ÄÉ‚Üí If user does not respond ‚Üí rendering is halted  

Enforcement Rules:  
‚Ä¢ No quote table may render without valid `quote_metadata`  
‚Ä¢ No GPT fallback, memory recomputation, or file guessing allowed  
‚Ä¢ Reload is terminal ‚Äî no in-place editing or patching permitted  

Compatibility Notes:  
‚Ä¢ Allows regeneration from saved TXT/PDF quote files with valid metadata  
‚Ä¢ Trigger must execute before any summary view, totals, or export is displayed  

Purpose:  
Guarantees that all quote outputs are driven by valid, immutable memory objects. Prevents contamination from inferred or partial quote states.

Trigger Conditions:  
‚Ä¢ User has access tier = `flawswatter`  
‚Ä¢ User enters a valid override command (markup value)  
‚ÄÉ‚Üí Acceptable values: whole numbers between 0‚Äì100  

Behavior:  
‚Ä¢ Override is applied before any totals are rendered  
‚Ä¢ Markup row label must reflect new value:  
‚ÄÉ‚Üí `Markup (XX%)`  
‚Ä¢ All calculations are re-evaluated using new percent  
‚Ä¢ Override is session-bound and does not persist after export  

Restrictions:  
‚Ä¢ Overrides are locked to developer-tier users only  
‚Ä¢ If user is not `flawswatter` ‚Üí override is silently ignored  
‚Ä¢ No chaining, multiplication, or conditional logic allowed  
‚Ä¢ Override is not shown in non-dev sessions  
‚Ä¢ Final markup row must always be displayed  

Purpose:  
Enables controlled markup testing for developers without exposing logic to regular users.

Status: ENFORCED  
Dependencies: ‚Äî  
Applies To: GPT Instructions, CSV Schema, Backend Parser, Edit Mode, Simulation Output  
Rule Scope: File Scoring  
Description:  
Each uploaded PDF must be scored based on its extractability and formatting consistency. The resulting value is a float between `0.00` and `1.00`, called `pdf_format_score`.

Scoring Inputs:  
‚Ä¢ Presence of text layer (searchable text)  
‚Ä¢ Detection of bounding boxes around fields  
‚Ä¢ OCR fallback presence  
‚Ä¢ Field density and positional structure  
‚Ä¢ Header/footer detection (non-BOM text)  

Formula (weighted):  
‚Ä¢ +0.4 = contains searchable text layer  
‚Ä¢ +0.2 = bounding boxes detected  
‚Ä¢ +0.2 = field positioning is grid-aligned  
‚Ä¢ +0.1 = OCR fallback usable  
‚Ä¢ +0.1 = header/footer density acceptable  
‚Ä¢ Total is capped at 1.00  

Behavior:  
‚Ä¢ The score is computed at file import time  
‚Ä¢ Stored in session memory as `pdf_format_score`  
‚Ä¢ Immutable after evaluation  

Purpose:  
Quantifies the structural quality of uploaded PDFs. Used to control downstream fallback behavior for OCR and parsing.

Applies To: GPT Instructions, CSV Schema, Backend Parser, Edit Mode, Simulation Output  
Rule Scope: OCR and Field Trust Enforcement  
Description:  
Controls how `pdf_format_score` is applied in logic. Sets thresholds for whether OCR or fallback field data can be used.

Rules:  
‚Ä¢ If `pdf_format_score ‚â• 0.5`:  
‚ÄÉ‚Üí OCR fields may be trusted  
‚ÄÉ‚Üí Fallback to `ocr_data[field]` is permitted if all structured sources fail  
‚Ä¢ If `pdf_format_score < 0.5`:  
‚ÄÉ‚Üí OCR fields must be discarded  
‚ÄÉ‚Üí Fallback fields may not be displayed or injected  

Restrictions:  
‚Ä¢ No memory or GPT-derived patching allowed  
‚Ä¢ Fields extracted under lockout conditions must be flagged and excluded  
‚Ä¢ The score must be checked explicitly in logic before fallback is attempted  

Purpose:  
Guarantees that fallback parsing (especially from OCR) is only used when structural quality meets a minimum standard.
